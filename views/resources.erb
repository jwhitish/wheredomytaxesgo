  <h4 id="process">HOW THE BUDGET PROCESS WORKS</h4>
  <p>Any discussion of the federal budget process really needs to first address that there are two ways to talk about the budgetary process: the way that it <em>should</em> should work, and the way that it <em>actually</em> works. It's also worth mentioning that the formal federal budget process has evolved over time since it wasn't explicitly laid out in the constitution. The part that was laid out simply said that congress has budgetary power for the government, but it neglected (by design or by intention) to spell out just exactly how they were to actually do that. Interestingly, it also does not have any mention that a president should take part in the process. Over time, Congress has enacted various laws that gradually shaped the process and created various governmental departments, such as the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office, to help manage the budget.</p>
  <p>So what does the process look like these days?</p>
